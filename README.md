### Hi, I'm Caroline! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer in Toronto focused on good UX/DX and code quality. I've been making websites for over a decade now; I can't believe it's been that long!

I'm still figuring out what else to put here; in the meantime, you can read more about me and look at some random things I drew many years ago on [my personal site](https://superchlorine.com)!
